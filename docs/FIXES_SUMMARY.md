# 🔧 **Comprehensive Fixes Applied**

## 📊 **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. ✅ **Usage Limits & Plan Sync Fixed**
**Problem**: Free users showing 0/0 prompts instead of 15, limits not enforced

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Fixed `app/api/user/subscription-status/route.ts`**: Now correctly shows 15 prompts for free plan
- **Enhanced `lib/utils/usage-tracker.ts`**: Ensures minimum 15 prompts for free users
- **Updated `components/UserSettings.tsx`**: Fixed display to show correct usage stats
- **Auto-creates users** with proper free plan defaults when they first sign up

**Result**: Free users now see "X / 15" prompts and "X / 3" projects correctly

### 2. ✅ **Project Opening Fixed**
**Problem**: Users could fetch projects but couldn't open them

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Fixed `components/ProjectsList.tsx`**: Now properly opens projects in builder
- **Enhanced `components/ProjectBuilder.tsx`**: Added project loading on mount
- **Added proper error handling** for failed project loads
- **Auto-loads project files** and sets active file when opening

**Result**: Clicking "View" on projects now opens them in the builder with all files loaded

### 3. ✅ **VS Code-like Builder Interface**
**Problem**: Builder page looked basic, not like VS Code

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Enhanced code editor** with syntax highlighting for TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON
- **Added line numbers** to the left sidebar like VS Code
- **Real-time editing** with proper textarea overlay
- **File tree structure** with proper folder organization
- **Status indicators** showing saved status, line count, character count

### 4. ✅ **EAS Build System**
**Problem**: Builds not working in serverless environment

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Enhanced `app/api/eas/build/route.ts`**: Uses EAS REST API instead of CLI
- **Serverless-compatible approach** that works on Netlify/Vercel
- **Fallback demo mode** when EAS API is not available
- **Clear error messages** with troubleshooting guides
- **Proper authentication** with EXPO_TOKEN

**Result**: Build system now works in serverless environments with proper error handling

---

### 5. ✅ **Usage Enforcement**
**Problem**: Limits weren't being enforced, users could generate beyond limits

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Enhanced limit checking** in generation API
- **Proper usage tracking** that increments on successful operations
- **Clear error messages** when limits are reached with upgrade prompts
- **Monthly reset functionality** working correctly

**Result**: Users are now properly limited by their plan and get clear upgrade prompts
